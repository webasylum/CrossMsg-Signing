# System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the system design for the ISO 20022 message signing and verification system.

## Content

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Message Processing Layer
- XML/JSON format conversion
- Canonicalization services
- Message validation

#### 2. Signature Layer
- Signature generation
- Signature verification
- Key management

#### 3. Integration Layer
- Message routing
- Format conversion
- Signature container management

### Phase Implementation

#### Phase 1: Classical Implementation
- RSA/ECDSA based signatures
- XML C14N + XMLDSig
- JSON Canonicalization + JWS
- Hybrid/Detached Hash

#### Phase 2: Hybrid Implementation
- Quantum-safe algorithm integration
- Hybrid signature support
- Backward compatibility layer

## Implementation Details
- Key management
- Signature verification
- Message integrity checks

## Containerized Development & Testing
- All builds, tests, and development tasks run inside Docker containers for consistency and reproducibility.
- Gradle is used for builds and test execution, replacing Maven.
- All unit and integration tests use JUnit 5, with a 5-minute timeout and resource cleanup.
- Test coverage includes canonicalization, signature persistence across format conversion, and negative cases (tampering, wrong key, etc.).
- Test results and coverage reports are available in `build/reports/`.
- Code is organized by strict layer separation (infrastructure, service, script, test), and all configuration is via environment variables.
- Dependency injection and constructor-based initialization are used throughout the codebase.
